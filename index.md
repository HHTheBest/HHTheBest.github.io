## Biography

I am currently a first-year master student in **arcSYSu**([ARChitecture and SYStem Upscaling @ SYSU](https://github.com/arcsysu)) in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), co-advised by [Assoc. Prof. Xianwei Zhang](https://xianweiz.github.io/) and [Prof. Yutong Lu](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2483). I receive my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology in Sun Yat-sen University in 2023.

My research interest is Compiler Approach in High Performance Computing. Currently I am working to design Programming Models for Exa-scale Supercomputers.
